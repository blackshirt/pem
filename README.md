This `pem` module implements a parser and encoder for PEM-encoded binary data for V Language. Its adapted</br>
from Rust versions of `pem` crates. The PEM format is a de facto file format for storing and sending </br> cryptographic keys, certificates, and other data. </br>

The PEM format was eventually formalized by the IETF in [RFC 7468](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7468)
